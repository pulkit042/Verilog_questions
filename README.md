# 🛠️ Verilog Practice Questions and Solutions
Welcome to my Verilog Coding Practice repository! 🚀
Here, I solve interesting Verilog problems by first stating the problem description and then writing a clean, modular Verilog solution.

In this repository I have added questions from basic to advanced level, also in the solution files I have personally added comments which will make learning more easy and efficient.

This repository is designed to strengthen Verilog skills and help those who are learning hardware description languages!
