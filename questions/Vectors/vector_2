VECTOR PART SELECT

Build a circuit that will reverse the byte ordering of the 4-byte word.
AaaaaaaaBbbbbbbbCcccccccDddddddd => DdddddddCcccccccBbbbbbbbAaaaaaaa
A 32-bit vector can be viewed as containing 4 bytes (bits [31:24], [23:16], etc.).
This operation is often used when the endianness of a piece of data needs to be swapped, for example between little-endian x86 systems and the big-endian formats used in many Internet protocols.
